_# Youth_

_"In southern Scandinavia,  
Still not in my dreams,  
I saw life’s highest edge,  
Felt freedom’s gentle streams.  
Questions came to me,  
Floating on the Baltic sea._

_Where is my youth rushing to?  
Does time leave its quiet mark?  
Have I sought to live for real,  
Or just followed some small spark?  
The scent of smoke drifted by,  
Carried softly on the sky._

_“When your wisdom is beyond your years,”  
“When your strength is fully known,”  
I smiled, unaware,  
Wrapped in warmth I’d never known,  
As if I’d found my path alone._

_Yet I want to be reckless, fit my age,  
To shout and laugh without a cage,  
To sigh and wail, my heart to bare,  
To pour my soul without a care._

_I want to be drunk on love and pain,  
To walk with you in that secret lane,  
To spread my wings toward the unknown,  
It doesn’t matter if I fall alone,  
Even if I never reach the throne,  
I want to be a fiery heart, fully grown."_
